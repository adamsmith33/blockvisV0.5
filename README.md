My project was the blockvis - A generative art piece that interpreted blockchain data into a visual format. 

When I thought of the blockchain, I felt that it was like a living organism, and each block has its own unique characteristics that age overtime. 

With that in mind, I wanted to use the Voyager API to create an artistic expression of a block on the blockchain that conveyed the dimensions of blocks visually.

My project was originally just supposed to be the visualizer, but I wanted to reach and try to develop a dapp that could interact with it.
I decided to try and make an NFT minter as an additional element to my project. However, I was unable to complete my front end.

Included in my submission I have my blockvis generative art files, along with my completed ERC721 NFT Contract. 

I was successfully able to deploy the contract here:
